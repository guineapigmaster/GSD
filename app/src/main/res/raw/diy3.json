        "title": "Boil Water",
        "text": "Heat about 2″ of water in the larger pot/double boiler, and once it’s warm, place the wax-filled pot inside it, ensuring that the water doesn’t spill into the smaller pot at all. Keep the water on medium-high heat until the wax and oil mixture has melted, whisking or stirring it gently to dissolve it evenly."

        "text": "Once it’s all melted, remove it from the heat, set it aside, and add your essential oils. (Note: The scent of them will dissipate a little bit, so feel free to add a few more drops than listed in the recipe if you feel it’s necessary. If you find that the mixture is starting to firm up, put it back over the heat to melt into liquid again.)"

        "text": "Use your dropper to transfer the liquid balm into your empty containers, and let them cool overnight (or about 10 hours) before closing them. Add cute labels as desired, and moisten up everyone’s lips to your heart’s content!"
