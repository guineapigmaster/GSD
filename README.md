# Get Stuff Done! (GSD)

Get Stuff Done suggests users new activities that might interest them by asking how much time they have and what they want to learn.

Currently the project/app is mostly developed on a proof of concept basis. There's a lot of scaling this app needs to do in the future.

The app uses JSON Objects and pictures embedded in the app in order to give out instructions. I would like to change this to a Parse server handling all the exchange of instructions, and add the capability to add more instructions via GSD. Picture implementation, login, and many more to come in the future.
